# Big-Data-Platform-Programming

#### What does it from?

The path following the course from [Prof. Lau Wing-Cheong](https://staff.ie.cuhk.edu.hk/~wclau/), great thanks to his hard work preparing all the big data technology introductions from theory on papers to practical examples, those are really challenge courses but worth it. :heart:

#### What is it about?

This repository includes my learning path of big data platform programming, including MapReduce and the Hadoop stack, Spark, Spark Streaming, Pig, Hive, setup steps of Hadoop and Spark over Kubernetes, usage of docker. I used database query language, Python, Scala and Shell programming to finish it. :books:

#### Future Work?

In the future, I will add more detailed *theory* :bookmark_tabs: notes (learn from papers) for the current tools used in this repository, more useful tools for data streaming processing including *Kafka, Spark Streaming and Flink* etc practical introductions. Also, find out more behind the scene, currently I am interested in distributed KV system like *etcd* and its implementation of Raft. :grey_question:
